# Twitter Clone: Full-Stack Development Practice

This React application was built to practice my existing front-end skills and expand upon my backend skills with database and API development. 

This application houses a Twitter clone. It will allow for posts (or tweets) to be created, shared, viewed, and liked among users. This application is still currently under development.
